# Random Tools

## SSL/TLS
- Openssl Expiry (expiration date of SSL cert when given a domain name)
- Smartcard signing: Sign files or code with a smartcard (only tested with Yubikey)

## Pentest Tools
- Cloud Scale Masscan Nmap Scanner (masscan and nmap combined to automate granular scans)

## Misc
- Weather redo (but then realized I could just use `curl wttr.in`)
